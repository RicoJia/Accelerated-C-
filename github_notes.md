1. Working on branches (versions)
a. git clone -b branch_name repo_name
            1. git branch -a            check all existing branches in your repo directory;  * means current branch; HEAD is the pointer pointing to your current branch
            2. git checkout -b new_branch_name          create a new branch and switch there
            3. git checkout exisiting_branch
            4. ls                               check out the files in the exisiting directory
            
b. commit the branch (saves)
        1. touch file_name             create a new file. Question: create new file on new branch, but it also shows up on the old branch????
        2. git status                       checl out files that are added. 
        3.
